## DATASET OVERVIEW

The dataset given consists of 66,541 hotel bookings between January 2010 and December 2019, from a company that helps international travelers around the world secure hotels in destination countries. It includes details like; bookings, hotel names, origin countries, gender, destination countries, customer id, gender etc that are essential to generate actionable insights for the enhancement of the company‚Äôs growth.

## DATA PREPARATION AND CLEANING 

To keep track of the data quality, I removed duplicate values resulting in the hotel bookings dropping to a total of 66,536 as opposed to the initial figure, 66,541.
I also deleted ‚ÄúNo of days column‚Äù as it was empty and irrelevant to analysis. 

## DATA ANALYSIS

I visualized my result in a dashboard which includes my insights, findings and recommendations for the company as seen below üëá:
