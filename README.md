## DATASET OVERVIEW

The dataset given consists of 66,541 hotel bookings between January 2010 and December 2019, from a company that helps international travelers around the world secure hotels in destination countries. It includes details like; bookings, hotel names, origin countries, gender, destination countries, customer id, gender etc that are essential to generate actionable insights for the enhancement of the company’s growth.

## DATA PREPARATION AND CLEANING 

To keep track of the data quality, I removed duplicate values resulting in the hotel bookings dropping to a total of 66,536 as opposed to the initial figure, 66,541.
I also deleted “No of days column” as it was empty and irrelevant to analysis. 

## DATA ANALYSIS 

I used Microsoft Excel for the data preparation, cleaning, analysis and visualization. My analysis was summarized using pivot tables as seen below:

My Key Performance Indicators are seen in the Visual below. I used the Pivot table in Power Pivot to determine the distinct counts of Total Customer, Total Hotel, Total Origin Country, Total Destination Country and Total Booking. This is because the Count Distinct Function is absent in the Normal Excel's Pivot Table.

I visualized my result in a dashboard which includes my insights, findings and recommendations for the company as seen below :
